Why did I make this?
The main purpose of this game was to make a game on a calculator. Just like any other programming langauge that I've learnt (GW-BASIC and JS), I've made an official clicker game for it. Hence why I settled for a clicker game rather than any other genre.

What is it about?
It's a text-based clicker game designed to run on a calculator. Not everyone has the specific calculator that I made this for, so I made an .exe file for those on Windows to have a go at playing it.

What were some limitaions?
The largest one being saving data. I could not do this because the calculator doesn't allow for such things. I decided to keep it the same for .exe file. Yes it's annoying, but it is supposed to be run on a calculator so what do you expect.

Will there be any further updates?
As of August 3rd of 2024, I do not plan on expanding onto this project. About bug fixes, I don't plan on fixing them either as if there is any, they shouldn't effect the gameplay too much.
