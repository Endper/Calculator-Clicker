## Why did I make this?
The main purpose of this game was to make a game on a calculator. Just like any other programming langauge that I've learnt (GW-BASIC and JS), I've made an official clicker game for it. Hence why I settled for a clicker game rather than any other genre.

## What is it about?
It's a text-based clicker game designed to run on a calculator (specifically the fx-9860GIII).

## What were some limitaions?
The largest one being saving data. I could not do this because the calculator doesn't allow for such things. Very annoying, I know.

## Will there be any further updates?
As of August 3rd of 2024, I do not plan on expanding onto this project. About bug fixes, I don't plan on fixing them either as if there is any, they shouldn't effect the gameplay too much.

As of March 27th of 2025, I am thinking about updating this project.

## How long did this take me?
Around 3 hours for the current version. The first version (1.0) took a little over an hour.
