# Calculator-Clicker v1.2.1 (Python Clicker)

This was my first official Python project (more of a game than anything). If you want to try it out, go ahead, the instructions are down below.

## If you want to run it on a calculator:
A clicker game that runs of a graphical calculator programmed in Python. The calculator that runs this is the fx-9860GIII.

# Changelog

## Version 1.3???
I'm considering adding more stuff like a casino with a betting system, trying to optimize the game more, fixing any bugs that might still be in there, and just improving the game overall.

_If you find any bugs, please let me know!_

# Set Up
---

## What to do with the .zip folder once it's downloaded?
- Download the code as a .zip folder.
- Proceed to extract the .zip folder by right clicking on it and pressing extract all, select the destination where to extract, click extract, wait till the extract is complete, open the extracted folder.
- Then connect your calculator using a USB micro cable to your computer.
- Select the first option by pressing F1 on your calculator.
- Wait patiently until it finishes setting up and opens file explorer.
- Copy and paste the .py file from the extracted folder into the usb (do not put it into the @main folder).
- Eject the usb by right clicking on the left side on the usb and selecting eject after the file has finished copying.
- You will get an error, ignore it, it's prolly not important.
- Press exit on your calculator.
- Remove the cable.
- Go into the Python section on your calculator.
- Find the file that you copied and press the EXE button.
- Wait till it loads and enjoy.

## If you want to run it on Windows:
For some reason while running it through VirusTotal, the (used to be, now deleted by me) executable was flagged malicious 8 times. 
Although I'm certain it's a false positive, I have removed the executable and may or may not add a new one later.

If you're now reconsidering downloading the .py file, you can view the file on github.
